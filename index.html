                <p>Technology today is evolving at such a rapid pace, enabling faster change and progress, causing an
                    acceleration of the rate of change, until eventually, it will become exponential. However, it is not
                    only technology trends and top technologies that are evolving, a lot more has changed this year due
                    to the outbreak of COVID-19 making IT professionals realize that their role will not stay the same
                    in the contactless world tomorrow. And an IT professional in 2020-21 will constantly be learning,
                    unlearning, and relearning (out of necessity if not desire).</p>
